# a_feast_with_dragons

A Python script for parsing ebooks of A Feast for Crows and A Dance with Dragons and recombining the chapters to make an ebook of A Feast with Dragons.

Kind of works (i.e., it makes an ebook with the chapters in the right order, but some ebook readers think the file is corrupted, and others can only remember which chapter you're reading, but not which page within a chapter).
